    <p id = "about"> I'm an aspiring student who wants to make a real impact by building solid, reliable software. 
      Outside of class, I'm often building Java projects and applying design patterns to write more maintainable and scalable code.
      Recently, I've been devoting more time to my craft and can't wait to share my progress with you here. </p>

    <p>While working toward my degree in Computer Science at Irvine Valley College, I always try to find tech-related opportunities. 
      One ongoing conversation on campus is Artificial Intelligence and how to incorporate it safely within the curriculum. This past semester, I wrote a
      <a href="resources/Public_ Chandler Cook - Writing Alongside AI.pdf" target="_blank">research paper</a> focused on AI and college writing courses,
      as I believe writing is one of the subjects most heavily impacted by AI. Additionally, I enjoy contributing to AI task forces around campus and hope to present 
      at the <a href="https://www.ivc.edu/honors/symposium" target="_blank">IVC/Saddleback Student Research Symposium</a> this fall.</p>

    <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading, practicing martial arts, working as a barista, working on my '73 VW, and playing video games like
